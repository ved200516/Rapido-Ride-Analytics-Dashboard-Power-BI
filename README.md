# Rapido-Ride-Analytics-Dashboard-Power-BI
I built a Rapido Ride Analytics Dashboard in Power BI to analyze bookings, revenue, distance, ratings, and cancellations. Added KPIs, monthly trends, payment analysis, and custom yellow-black UI with icons. Includes slicers for month, payment method, and city.
This project is a complete Rapido Ride Analytics Dashboard built using Power BI.
It helps analyze ride bookings, revenue, distance, customer ratings, and rider behavior.

-->Work I Do:
Cleaned and prepared the Rapido dataset (50,000+ rows)
Removed duplicates, handled missing values, and normalized text columns
Created important KPIs:
Total Bookings
Total Revenue
Average Distance
Avg Rating
Lost/Canceled Rides

Built interactive charts:
Bookings Trend by Month
Revenue by Payment Method
Revenue by Month
Pickup & Drop Location Insights

Added slicers for Month, Payment Mode, and City
Designed a custom Rapido Yellow + Black themed background
Added sidebar icons for better navigation

📊 Key Insights

This project helped me improve Power BI visualization, DAX, and dashboard design skills.
